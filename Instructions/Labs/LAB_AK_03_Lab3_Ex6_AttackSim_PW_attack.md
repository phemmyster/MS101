# Learning Path 3 - Lab 3 - Exercise 6 - Conduct a Drive-by URL attack using Attack Simulation training

Holly Dickson is concerned that some users at Adatum may require education about selecting URL links to familiar websites that are either fake or have been hacked. This type of attack is known as a Drive-by URL attack. With this type of attack, a target receives an email containing a URL link, and when the target selects the link, they are taken to a website that runs background code whose sole purpose is to gather information about the target or deploy arbitrary code to their device. As part of her pilot project, Holly has decided to use the Microsoft 365 Attack simulation training feature to determine her users' susceptibility to Drive-by URL attacks.

**Note:** At the end of this exercise, you will disable MFA for Holly's account. This will save you from having to enter the second form of authentication when signing in as Holly in any of the remaining labs in this course.


### Task 1: Configure and launch a Drive-by URL attack 

In a Drive-by URL attack, the website attempting to lure the target will typically be a well-known website that has been compromised in some fashion, or a clone of a well-known website itself. The hacker hopes that familiarity with the website builds trust in the target, to the point where the target feels that it's safe to select the URL link. Holly wants to create a Drive-by URL attack using a rip-off of the Tailspin Toys website. Tailspin Toys is a nationally known toy store that is constantly offering promotions on TV and throughout social media. Holly wants to use this familiarity with the Tailspin Toys name brand to offer an enticing promotion for free toys as part of her attack simulation training. This will enable her to see how many Adatum employees are susceptible to this type of attack. 

In the prior lab, you created a simulation that was sent to all Adatum users. You also used an existing payload template for the simulation. In this lab exercise, you will only roll out the simulation to Lynne Robbins, and you will create your own custom payload.  

1. You should still be in LON-CL1 and signed in as the local **Admin** account with a password of **Pa55w.rd**; if not, then sign in now.  

2. After the previous lab exercise, you should still be in the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal, and you should still be logged in as Holly Dickson; if not, then do so now.

Select the **Due Date** field. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **7 days after Simulation ends** and then select **Next**.

29. On the **Landing page** window, you will accept the default settings for now. These settings use the **Microsoft default landing page** and the **Microsoft Landing Page Template 1**. <br/>

	Select the **Open preview panel** button that appears below the **Payload Indicators** section. 

30. A preview of the **Microsoft landing page** appears in the pane on the right. This preview panel provides an example of what the landing page will look like when someone experiences a Drive-by URL attack and the simulation uses **Microsoft Landing Page Template 1**. Scroll down through this preview panel and review the features of this template. When you're finished, select the **Close** button at the bottom of the preview panel. 

31. You will now look at some of the other landing page templates until you find one that you want to use for this simulation. On the **Landing page** window, in the **Select landing page layout** field, select one of the other templates and then select **Open preview panel**. Examine the preview panel and note how the landing page for this template is different from **Microsoft Landing Page Template 1**. When you're finished, select the **Close** button at the bottom of the preview panel.

32. Repeat the prior step and select another template. Note how this template is different from the other two you looked at. Repeat this step as many times as you would like until you find a template that you want to use for this simulation. Once you're satisfied with a template, select **Next** on the **Landing page**.

33. On the **Select end user notification** page, choose how you want the end user to be notified. For the purpose of this lab, select **Microsoft default notification (recommended)**. In the list of notifications that appears, configure the following notifications:

36. On the **Review Simulation** page, review the entered information. If anything needs to be changed, select the appropriate **Edit** option to make the change. Once everything is correct, select **Submit**. It may take a few minutes before you receive a confirmation stating **Simulation has been scheduled for launch**. Select **Done**.


### Task 2: Review the Drive-by URL attack results

You will now review the results of the Drive-by URL simulation attack that you just launched. In this task, you will verify whether your organization has received the email that you configured in the Attack simulation training. You will then review the results associated with the Drive-by URL attack that you simulated.

1. Switch to the **LON-CL2** VM and, if necessary, log in as the local **Admin** account with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2. In the Edge browser, you should have two tabs open - one with Lynne Robbins' Outlook mailbox, and one with the landing page from the attack simulation that you conducted in the prior lab exercise. Select the tab containing Lynne Robbins' Outlook mailbox.

7. In Lynne's Outlook Inbox, you should see the email that was sent by the Attack Simulator that's from **klemens@tailspintoys.com**. The subject of the email is **Free toy giveaway promotion from Tailspin Toys**. Select the email to open it and review the details in the body of the message. 

	**NOTE!** It can take up to 15 minutes for the email to arrive.  Wait for the email before proceeding.

8. Select the link that is included in the email. Even though you know this is a Drive-by URL attack, this will enable you to see the effect of doing so in the Attack Simulator report that tracks the results of the spear phishing campaign. <br/>

	Selecting this link displays a web page that explains how you have been redirected to it as part of a Phishing awareness test being run by your organization.  Read through the contents of this site, which uses the landing page template that you selected in the prior task when setting up the attack simulation. 

11. In the **Outlook** tab in your Edge browser, select the picture of Lynne Robbins in the upper-right corner of the window. In Lynne's profile window that appears, select **Sign out**.

12. Once Lynne is signed out, close the Edge browser.

13. Switch back to **LON-CL1**.

14. In your browser session where you are logged in as Holly Dickson, you should still be on the **Attack simulation training** page. If the **Drive by URL - Free offer** simulation does not appear in the **Recent Simulations** list, select the **Refresh** icon to the left of the URL on the address bar. The **Drive by URL - Free offer** simulation should now appear. Select the **Drive by URL - Free offer** simulation to view the diagnostic results that were captured for this simulation.

15. A **Drive by URL - Free offer** page should appear. Review all the information collected for this simulated attack. When you're finished, select the **X** in the upper right-hand corner of the window to close it. 

16. Leave your browser open in LON-CL1 and do not close any of the tabs.


### Task 3: Disable Multi-factor Authentication for the Global Admin

To use Microsoft's Attack simulation training to simulate phishing attacks, Holly enabled Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for her user account. Now that she has completed the Attack simulation training tests, she wants to disable MFA for her account so that she doesn't have to deal with MFA for the remainder of the pilot project.

1. You should still be logged into **LON-CL1** as the local **Admin** account, and in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Holly Dickson**.

2. To disable MFA for Holly Dickson's user account, you must first access the **Active users** list in the Microsoft 365 admin center. If you have the **Microsoft 365 admin center** open in a browser tab, then select that now; otherwise, open a new browser tab, enter **https://portal.office.com** in the address bar, and then on the **Office 365 home** page, select the **Admin** icon that appears in the column of app icons on the left-side of the screen. This opens the **Microsoft 365 admin center** in a new browser tab. 

3. On the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Users** and then select **Active users**.

4. In the **Active users** window, on the menu bar at the top of the user list, select **Multi-factor authentication**.

5. In the **multi-factor authentication** window, the **users** tab is displayed by default. Select the check box for **Holly Dickson**, and in Holly's properties pane on the right, select **Disable**.

6. On the **Disable multi-factor authentication?** dialog box, select **yes**. 

7. When the **Updates successful** dialog box appears, select **close**. In the **multi-factor authentication** window, verify Holly's MFA Status has changed to **Disabled**. Close the **Multi-factor authentication** tab in your browser.

8. You must now sign out of Microsoft 365 as Holly and then sign back in as Holly (without MFA). To do so, perform the following steps: <br/>

	- Select Holly's account icon (HD in a circle) at the top-right of the screen and in Holly's profile window, select **Sign out**.
	- Close your browser session and all browser tabs (to clear your cache).
	- Open a new Edge browser session.
	- Enter the **https://portal.office.com** URL.
	- In the **Pick an account** window, select Holly's account and enter **User.pw1** as the **Password**.
	- From the **Microsoft Office Home** page, select the **Admin** icon to navigate to the **Microsoft 365 admin center**.
	
	You are now ready to proceed to the next lab exercise.
